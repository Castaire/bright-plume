Hey Kelowna!<br/><br/>We are really excited to be here!<br/>Ending our extended search, my family and I have finally found a cozy and functional space in this city to make our mark on the local cuisine.<br/><br/>We offer all the well-loved staples as well as traditional specialty dishes commonly enjoyed in the Sichuan and Hunan provinces.
<br/></br>
With 20 years of professional experience, we will be putting our best <strike>foot</strike> food forwards from this kitchen. Thanks for visiting us!<br/><br/>Please join us for our grand opening on <b>June 18th</b>!
